# AI Usage Report: Portfolio Website Development

This report documents the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** (accessed via web browser interfaces) in the development of the Portfolio website.

The LLMs were used primarily as advanced learning aids, documentation assistants, and code optimizers. All final code structure, design decisions, and core logic were implemented and verified by the author.

## Specific Areas of AI Assistance

The LLMs were consulted for guidance, explanation, and efficiency across several phases of the project:

### 1. CSS Design and Aesthetics (Idea Generation & Refinement)

* **Initial Background Generation:** An LLM was prompted to generate an initial CSS structure for a **"deep indigo/neon glow background"** using advanced techniques like `radial-gradient`, `conic-gradient`, and `mix-blend-mode`.  
  * *Author's Role:* The resulting code was heavily edited, refined, and customized by the author to achieve the specific visual goals (e.g., setting the precise color values, sizes, positions, and defining the `@keyframes folds` animation).  
* **Styling Guidance:** Received suggestions on modern CSS practices, such as using `clamp()` for responsive font sizing and applying `backdrop-filter` for a "glassy" navbar effect.  
* **Mobile Responsiveness:** Consulted on adding media queries to adjust section padding and font sizes for smaller screens.  

### 2. Code Debugging and Troubleshooting

* **Error Identification:** When specific functionality, such as the contact form submission or the clock update, did not work as expected, snippets of the non-functional code were shared with an LLM.  
  * *Result:* The LLM helped identify subtle syntax errors, scope issues (especially in JavaScript), and corrected minor errors in CSS selector usage.  
* **Component Explanation:** Asked LLMs to clarify the behavior of specific CSS properties (like `inset: -20%`) or complex JavaScript methods (like `Date().getHours()` and `padStart()`).  

### 3. Documentation and Code Clarity

* **Code Commenting:** Used an LLM to generate detailed, line-by-line comments for some highly dense or complex sections of code, such as the multiple gradients in `body::before` and `body::after` in `styles.css`. This process helped solidify the author's understanding of the code's function.   
* **README Structure:** Asked LLMs what essential sections a professional technical project README should contain (e.g., Overview, Features, Tech Stack, Project Structure, Setup).  
* **Markdown Formatting:** Received guidance on organizing the final README content using appropriate Markdown syntax (headings, lists, code blocks, and tables).  

### 4. Content Refinement and Summarization

* **Project Summarization:** Shared the original, longer descriptions of academic projects (e.g., ML, full-stack systems) and used the LLM to refine the writing, ensuring each project summary was concise, impactful, and clearly highlighted the key skills used.  
* **"About Me" Section:** Requested help in refining the language and tone of the personal statement to ensure it sounds professional and accurately reflects the author's passion and goals.  
* **Tagline Exploration:** Explored creative tagline options for the hero section with AI support before finalizing.

## Author's Declaration

The AI tools served as collaborators and instructional resources. The final integration, artistic vision, structural integrity, and logic of all components in `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` were designed, reviewed, and implemented by the author.
